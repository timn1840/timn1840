I am passionate about math and statistics, and I enjoy applying these concepts to solve complex problems and predict risk in the insurance industry. Currently, I am enhancing my technical skills in data analytics, data visualization, and storytelling using Excel, SQL, Python, R, and Tableau.

I am currently enrolled in the TripleTen 4-month Business Intelligence Analytics program to further develop my skills and storytelling abilities. The curriculum covers Python, Excel, SQL, Tableau, and Power BI, and includes numerous practical projects. At the end of the program, I will also have the opportunity to work on an externship, allowing me to gain hands-on experience with a practical project from a company</p>
